#### Hello! This project is part of a multi-part mock website series in which I try to simulate existing websites to brush up on my UX & UI design skills. These mock versions will mostly be done in basic HTML CSS, using Figma wireframes and a touch of JS if needed. 

#### I incorporate HTML & CSS tools I've learned from Nashville Software School's UX/UI Digital Product Design course..... 

#### In the V2 build, I hope to incorporate .... Please enjoy!
